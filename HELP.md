# Search and Destroy v2.0.0 instruction manual

"xcp" targets a campaign mob.  If area cp, also runs to area and does hunt trick. 
 - 'xcp' alone targets the first available cp mob (i.e. living and location known)
 - 'xcp <number>' targets a specific mob, dead or alive.
 - 'xcp mode <ht|qw|off>' makes "xcp" do hunt trick, quick where, or nothing upon running to an area.
 - Unknown location (i.e. room not mapped) mobs can't be targeted, because S&D needs the area or room id to find them.
